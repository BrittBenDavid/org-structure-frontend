This project is used by organizations for managing tasks between the managers in the organization and their employees.

Each manager can send tasks to his employee and the employee can respond to these tasks.

The frontend is written in React and interfaces with the backend written in node.js and the retrieved addresses for a dedicated demo DB that I managed in MySQL.

Run the backend and run "npm start" on the frontend, adjust DB and use the interface.
